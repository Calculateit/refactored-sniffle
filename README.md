# refactored-sniffle
Oversimplified Midnight Commander`s copy. Gives you ability to view filesystem, create/remove, rename, move/copy files and directories, quickly browse different files in text mode. Designed for Linux-based OS, so errors can only be seen in terminal window.
Made with C++(std-2a), SDL 2.0.
